# Platformer-game
A platformer game built using canvas

## Description

Welcome to Electric Slide! This is a simple platformer game built using vanilla JavaScript. You are the green box and your goal is to glide as much as possible. The more you glide, the more points you rack up! Gliding on higher rails will award extra points. You can earn a points multiplier that increases the longer you stay off the ground and remain sliding.
